# LinkedIn Post - Daraja MCP Server

🚀 Excited to share my latest open-source project: **Daraja MCP Server** - bridging the gap between AI and mobile payments in Kenya! 🇰🇪

I've built a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates Safaricom's M-PESA Daraja API with Claude AI, enabling natural language payment processing. Here's what makes it special:

✨ **Key Features:**
• Natural language payment requests - "Send 500 KES to 0712345678 for order #INV-001"
• Real-time payment callbacks with Flask server
• Payment history tracking with read/unread status
• Full sandbox support for safe testing
• Production-ready with Railway deployment config

🔧 **Tech Stack:**
• Python 3.10+
• Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI integration
• Flask for callback handling
• Gunicorn for production deployment
• Railway for cloud hosting

💡 **The Problem It Solves:**
Traditional payment APIs require developers to write code for every transaction. This project lets you process M-PESA payments through natural language conversations with Claude, making payment integration more accessible and intuitive.

🎯 **Use Cases:**
• E-commerce platforms needing payment integration
• Customer service bots handling payments
• Automated invoice processing
• Payment tracking and reconciliation systems

The project includes comprehensive documentation, test suites, and deployment guides. It's fully open-source and ready for production use!
